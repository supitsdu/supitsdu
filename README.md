## ðŸ‘‹ Hey there!

I'm on the path to becoming a Software Engineer, driven by my passion for coding. With 8 years of tinkering with code as a hobby, I've decided to dive deeper and pursue a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering.

Outside of coding, I'm diving into GitHub for collaborations and projects, and I rely on Notion to keep my thoughts organized.

When I'm not coding, I'm immersed in the timeless tales of Greek mythology, and I'm a huge fan of alternative/indie music, especially bands like Gang of Youths. I also love outdoor activities like running.

Sunday nights are all about unwinding with anime and enjoying the little things in life. So that's me â€“ coding, exploring, vibing to great tunes, and savoring life's moments.

## ðŸ§  Problem Solving

I enjoy challenging myself on platforms like LeetCode, where I tackle problems not only in the languages I'm proficient in but also in new languages that I'm striving to master, such as Go and Rust.
